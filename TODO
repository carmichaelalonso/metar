Current and future projects
---------------------------

1. Create unit tests for the individual group parsers in Metar.py

2. Provide better documentation.

3. Consider changing the API for the metar.Datatypes classes to be more
   Pythonic, e.g., provide them with __str__ and __float__ methods.

4. Make the metar.Datatypes classes immutable, so that objects can be reused.
   A large fraction of the time it takes to initialize a Metar object is in
   the instantiation of the metar.Datatypes objects.
